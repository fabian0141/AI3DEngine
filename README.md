The goal of this project is to generate realisitc plants and caves using machine learning. 

Steps to achieve:
 - Create a basic 3D engine with AI actors (I'm here)
   - Generate race tracks procedurally
   - Build race environment
   - Implement realisitc graphics(raytracing, ...)
   - Create AI cars using HMM
 - Generate 2D images using simple GANs
 - Generate 3D plants and cave walls using voxels and 3D GANs


Build:
From inside project folder
 - cmake -S . -B build
 - make -C build
 - build/Engine
